# Week 10 - In Class Activity 
## Docker Compose Exercise

1. Clone (or Fork) this repository
2. Make the `Dockerfile` for the `web` and for the `db` directories.
    
    * To construct the Dockerfile, you will need to review the structure of the web application.
    * The database in here is mongodb
3. Create `docker-compose.yml` file in the root, and add the `web` and `db` Dockerfiles into `docker-compose.yml`. Note that the steps are explained in the slides, in week 10 folder in the LMS (MyCourses/Canvas)
4. Run docker-compose: `docker-compose up`
5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
